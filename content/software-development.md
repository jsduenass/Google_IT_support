# Objectives as a programmer
> our job as a programmer is to express computation 

take into account room of improvement making it understandable
 
question: programming in a globalized world with many different languanges both natural and programming languages. how do this programs intertac and operate in an incresingly complicated and entagled globlal system?.
> Concerns about correctness, simplicity, and efficiency become ours the minute we start writting code for others and accept the responsability to do that well, that is, we must accept that responsability when we decide to become professinonals.

>almost all of the time we are just interested in knowing how to call afunction - seeing the definition would just be a distracting


# Know the tools

Where to start 


## programming languages
interpret vs compiple

# Dissect C++
C++ is acompiled language, type safety
the standar library 
programs are intended fo tow audiences the computer and the programmers that is why comments are so important.

## compilers

* GCC
* Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) 
* Clang
* Intel C++
* MinGW  compiler for windows



GDB is a portable command-line based debugging platform
 to get it on linux 
    sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb
g++ is a command line interface for the MinGW compiler

> C  is  by  far  the  most  successful  language  providing  the  programmer  with  a  programming  model  thatclosely  matches  the  machine  model

pointers and memory

__header:__ are files containing definitions end with the suffix .h

# text editor

visual studio code

    g++ --help
    g++ --version
    g++ -print-search-dirs
    g++ -dumpmachine
    g++ -o /bin/hola.exe hola.cpp
    gdb --version
    
    .\bin\hola.exe
    start ./bin/hola.exe

headers

executable or machine code

linking

error types:
* compile error
* linker erros
* run-time
* logic errors

vector vs array, vector allows to have a collection of values of unspecified size where elements can be added or remove when using vector one needs to ```#include vector```


## error assumptions
Unless specified otherwise we asume that a program:
1. Should produce the desired results for all ligal inputs
2. Should give reasonable error messages for all ilegal inputs
3. Need not worry about misbehaving hardware
4. Need not worry about misbehaving software
5. Is allow to terminate after finding an error

## source of error checklist
* Poor Specification: it is no clearly define what the program should do. how does this relate with machine learning where the problem by is not well defined?
