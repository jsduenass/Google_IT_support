# Objectives as a programmer
> our job as a programmer is to express computation 

take into account room of improvement making it understandable
 
question: programming in a globalized world with many different languanges both natural and programming languages. how do this programs intertac and operate in an incresingly complicated and entagled globlal system?.
> Concerns about correctness, simplicity, and efficiency become ours the minute we start writting code for others and accept the responsability to do that well, that is, we must accept that responsability when we decide to become professinonals.

>almost all of the time we are just interested in knowing how to call a function - seeing the definition would just be a distracting

* name of the program
* the porpuse 
* who wrote it and when
* version number 
* how the source code is organized
* what assumptions are made about the inputs
* what parts of the code are still missing or not being handle

rigth now a computer seems like an magic black box to the user. he/she has no grasp on how the machine is structured  and the layers that interface with one another, therefore the user is limited to interact with the computer in a very narrow way channel trhough  graphical interface. The hability to pick 
inside and look to the structure on how the different application interacts wil allow the user to use the tool the computer represents, by being able to draw its on to interecat with the machine and this will inturn allow him/her to link toguether different application and enhance interoperability.


automation being thougth as replacement of the human loses it's true potential, the real focus of automation should be to build tools that empower humans allowing them to realize their ideas in a more efficient and effective manner.

> Old code is literally the crystallized logic and thoughts of someone long ago. In understanding the code, you are re-constructing that person's thoughts. Even when that someone is yourself, you as an individual change over the months and years, and best practices evolve, so even when you yourself wrote the code it always feels slightly foreign. -- Haoyi's Programming Blog

pydoc is a built in tool for creating and displaying  documentation of packages and functions, it works both in the command line and by creating a web server to explore the content.

```
    pydoc -n localhost
