# Objectives as a programmer
> our job as a programmer is to express computation 

take into account room of improvement making it understandable
 
question: programming in a globalized world with many different languanges? both natural and programming languages. how do this programs intertac and operate in an incresingly complicated and entagle goblal system.


# Know the tools

Where to start 


## programming languages
interpret vs compiple

# Dissect C++
C++ is acompiled language, type safety
the standar library 
programs are intended fo tow audiences the computer and the programmers that is why comments are so important.

## compilers

* GCC
* Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) 
* Clang
* Intel C++
* MinGW  compiler for windows



GDB is a portable command-line based debugging platform
 to get it on linux 
    sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb
g++ is a command line interface for the MinGW compiler

> C  is  by  far  the  most  successful  language  providing  the  programmer  with  a  programming  model  thatclosely  matches  the  machine  model

pointers and memory

__header:__ are files containing definitions end with the suffix .h

# text editor

visual studio code

    g++ --help
    g++ --version
    g++ -print-search-dirs
    g++ -dumpmachine
    g++ -o /bin/hola.exe hola.cpp
    gdb --version
    
    .\bin\hola.exe
    start ./bin/hola.exe
