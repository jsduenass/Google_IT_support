> plenty of kids today aren't digital natives ... whose entire interaction with technology is limited to closed platforms withgraphical user interfaces (GUIs)

> In my day job, where I design the sort of silicon chips that we use in the Raspberry Pi as a processor and work on the low-level software that runs on them, I basically get paid to sit around all day playing

>  From a position in the mid-1990s, when 17-year-olds wanting to read Computer Science had come to the University with a grounding in several computer languages, knew a bit about hardware hacking, and often even worked in assembly language, we gradually found ourselves in a position where, by 2005, those kids were arriving having done some HTML—with a bit of PHP and Cascading Style Sheets if you were lucky. They were still fearsomely clever kids with lots of potential, but their experience with computers was entirely different from what we’d been seeing before.

>physical computing—building systems using sensors, motors, lights and microcontrollers—is something that gets overlooked in favour of pure software projects in a lot of instances,
