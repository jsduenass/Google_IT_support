# Operating Systems and You: Becoming a Power user
As stated in the first module an operating system is a piece of software that manage, alocates and give  access to the resources of the device.

## week 1

We are going to learn the basics on tools like file manager or  command line interfaces like __cmd__ and __power shell__ in windows and __terminal__ in linux.
